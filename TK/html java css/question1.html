		<li>Plan and design:<br> Based on the requirements gathered, I would create a plan and design for the website. This would include deciding on the layout, color scheme, typography, and other design elements.</li></p>
        <li>Develop:<br> Once the design is finalized, I would start developing the website. This would involve creating the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the website.</li></p>
        <li>Test:<br> After development is complete, I would test the website to ensure that it works as expected. This would include testing for functionality, usability, and compatibility across different devices and browsers.</li></p>
        <li>Deploy:<br> Once testing is complete, I would deploy the website to a web server so that it can be accessed by users.</li></p>
        <li>Maintain:<br> After deployment, I would continue to maintain and update the website as needed to ensure that it remains functional and up-to-date.</li></p>
